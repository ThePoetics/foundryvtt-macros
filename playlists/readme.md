I feel that a large part of the atmosphere of an RPG session can be influenced and 
heightened (or detracted) by the choice of ambient background music. In an effort 
to elevate sessions around my table, I've gone through a large library of video game, 
movie, and TV show soundtracks, and found individual songs that I find suitable.

Ideally these tracks do not pull focus from the scene at hand and while there were 
many other, very good and well-crafted tracks across my collection, they had too many 
musical stingers or moments of excitement which didn't fit the overall ambient theme I 
was aiming for in a given soundtrack.

Future plans include adding mood-specific tracks, as well as playlists specific for 
Modern settings such as games set in *Shadowrun* or *Cyberpunk*, and several specific 
to my love of *Legend of the Five Rings*.
