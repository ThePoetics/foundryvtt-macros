Useful JavaScript macros I've put together (often with lots of help) for my online RPGs played through (FoundryVTT)[https://foundryvtt.com/].

While each macro has a small comment at the top describing its use, here are more complete descriptions:

* Hover Health -- changes all on-scene tokens to display health only on hover
* Journal Final -- a quickbar macro which opens a specific journal to the final page, very useful for long-running journals such as game logs
* Random Player -- sometimes I need to choose a player at random, this will whisper me a random player's name
* Random Ptolus Events -- only useful for a [Ptolus](https://www.montecookgames.com/welcome-to-ptolus/)-based campaign, this macro lets me roll on the (enormous) table of random city events, with additional options generated by myself
* SR5 Create Contact -- used in the Shadowrun game system, this macro generates a Contact from a token, keeping its name and token image
* SR5 Roll News -- I have created a long list of potential news events; this macro randomizes corporation names and presents a list of "word on the street" headlines I use on my landing page
* SwapDoors -- a very hacky method I put together for automatically enabling/disabling walls for a maze-like one-shot map. Originally written for Foundry v9, there are now many more elegant ways to do this, including using modules such as [Matt's Active Tile Triggers](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/monks-active-tiles/) to automate this whole thing
* Update Landing Text -- I have a landing page with character pictures, and this script will randomize the text descriptions/names displayed beneath each one. A little hacky (updating each one manually rather than *en masse*) but it's simple and it works for my needs
